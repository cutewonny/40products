1. A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.
2. An engaged woman is always more agreeable than a disengaged. She is satisfied with herself. Her cares are over, and she feels that she may exert all her powers of pleasing without suspicion.
3. A woman, especially, if she has the misfortune of knowing anything, should conceal it as well as she can.
